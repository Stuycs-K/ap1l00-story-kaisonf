Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no <REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> 
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on economics, I thought I would explore about 
a little and see the beautiful part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the 
people and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the world; 
whenever it is a rainy, cold November in my classroom; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
coding before coffin dudes, and bringing up the rear of every person I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a high
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately throwing into the ocean, and methodically 
stop people's jobs off—then, I account it high time to get to home as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all philosophers in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the code with me.
